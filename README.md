# Technical Cheatsheets

A living archive of my technical standards from 2020–2026. This repo tracks my journey from frontend architecture toward AI platform engineering. Legacy folders are preserved for historical context; `/active` reflects my current production standards for the tech I work with on a day-to-day basis.

- **`/legacy`** — Archived references for maintaining older codebases and architectural context.
- **`/active`** — Current focus: production standards and day-to-day reference material.
