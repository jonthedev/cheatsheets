# Technical Cheatsheets

A multi-year evolution of my technical standards. From jQuery and SCSS to Vue, Go, and AI platform engineering.

- **`/legacy`** — Archived references preserved for architectural context and maintaining older codebases.
- **`/active`** — Current production standards: Vue, Go, DevOps, and AI infrastructure.

Everything else lives at the root as general reference material.
