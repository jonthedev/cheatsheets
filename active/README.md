Current production standards and reference material.

---

- **vue** — Ecosystem resource (cert prep, Nuxt, Pinia, VueUse, etc.); `legacy/` for Vuex and Vue 2
- **go** — Go for services and tooling
- **devops** — Docker, Kubernetes, kubectl, and infrastructure

This is where I keep my primary reference material for day-to-day work and ongoing learning.
