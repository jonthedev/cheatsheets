# DEV OPS

---

## DevOps Definition

A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.

What does DevOps mean for teams? DevOps enables formerly siloed roles—development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security—to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals faster.

## The benefits of DevOps

Teams that adopt DevOps culture, practices, and tools become high-performing, building better products faster for greater customer satisfaction. This improved collaboration and productivity is also integral to achieving business goals like these:

- Accelerating time to market
- Adapting to the market and competition
- Maintaining system stability and reliability
- Improving the mean time to recovery

## DevOps and the application lifecycle

DevOps influences the application lifecycle throughout its plan, develop, deliver, and operate phases. Each phase relies on the others, and the phases are not role-specific. In a true DevOps culture, each role is involved in each phase to some extent.

## Plan

In the planning stage, DevOps teams develop ideas and define and describe the features and capabilities of the applications and systems they build. They track progress at low and high levels of granularity, from jobs for a single product to jobs running across entire portfolios of multiple products. By creating backlogs, debugging, managing flexible software development with Scrum, using kanban boards, and visualizing progress with dashboards, DevOps teams can plan flexibility and visibility, among other things.

Empower teams to manage their work with agility and full visibility across products and projects. Define, track, and lay out work with Kanban boards, backlogs, custom dashboards, and reporting capabilities using [Azure Boards]('https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/boards/').

Explore analytics with visuals and turn data into insights with [Power BI]('https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/').

## Develop

The develop phase includes all aspects of coding—writing, testing, reviewing, and the integration of code by team members—as well as building that code into build artifacts that can be deployed into various environments. DevOps teams seek to innovate rapidly without sacrificing quality, stability, and productivity. To do that, they use highly productive tools, automate mundane and manual steps, and iterate in small increments through automated testing and continuous integration.

## Deliver

Delivery is the process of deploying applications in production environments in a consistent and reliable manner. Also, in the delivery phase, the fully managed fundamental infrastructure that makes up those environments is deployed and configured.

In the delivery phase, teams define a release management process with clear, manual approval stages. They also set up automated gates to move applications between phases until they are made available to customers. By automating these processes, they become scalable, repeatable and controlled. This way, teams engaged in DevOps can deliver with ease, confidence, and peace of mind.

## Operate

The operational phase consists of maintaining and monitoring applications in production environments and solving any problems. By adopting DevOps practices, teams ensure system reliability, high availability and zero downtime while strengthening security and management. DevOps teams try to identify issues before the customer notices and quickly resolve issues when they arise. To remain continuously alert, teams need rich telemetry, helpful notifications, and full visibility into applications and the underlying system.
