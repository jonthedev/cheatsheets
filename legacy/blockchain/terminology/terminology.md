## Blockchain

When it comes to a blockchain, the blocks are what makes it up.

Simply put, blocks are just a collection of data.

In terms of Bitcoin, this data is transactions from one account to another account.

In terms of Ethereum, it's transactions AND Smart Contracts (the next lesson!).

Blocks are usually not that big, and how fast they are created is determined by the blockchain.

Bitcoin's 'block time' is 10 minutes.

Ethereum's 'block time' is 10 seconds.

#### Chaining

Every block starts with a very important piece of data.

A summary of the last block.

After the summary, they include their data, and then they summarize the summary + new data.

I know this is confusing, but here's a picture to help:

## Howey Test = Security Token

1. Is there an expectation that the purchased token will make money for the investor.

2. Do the management of the enterprise providing the token work to make its value increase.

## ICOS

ICOs are pre-product, so an investor is taking a big chance on something that does not yet exist in the marketplace.

## MINING

Why does it get harder to earn cryptos from mining as more miners participate?

In order to regulate the issuance of new cryptos, the processing overhead of new transactions increases which requires faster, more expensive hardware.

#### What is consensus?

Consensus is the governance model in distributed ledger technology.

## Smart Contracts

Hopefully you've found my explanations about DeFi and Blockchains so useful that you're still here!

In this lesson, I'm going to explain Smart Contracts so simply that an 8 year old could understand.

So by now we know that a blockchain stores data...

We also know that DeFi copies financial tools and makes them available for everyone...

but Smart Contracts are the technical part that allows that.

Smart Contract: An agreement written in code that follows rules set up by all the parties involved.

Basically, smart contracts are programmed agreements.

We can write things like this:

"If Theodore gives us $100, give him 7% interest each year"
"If John gives us $5, select a random number and if it's odd, give him $9 back"
"If Susan gives us 5 Ethereum, give her back 1200 Uniswap tokens"
That is a very basic smart contract.

If we hire a bunch of really smart people, we can write smart contracts that literally offer us automobile insurance.

We can create borrowing and lending platforms, gambling games, and even "safer" margin trading platforms!

Smart contracts are the very basis of every "decentralized application" out there.

In fact, Decentralized Applications, or dApps (for short), in the next lesson.

# DApps

In short, dApps are apps that are written using smart contracts.

They allow us to do fun things using blockchain technology... like:

Trade tokens for other tokens
Invest our tokens so that others can trade with them
Lend out our tokens to earn interest
Play games
Gamble like a casino
Modal things like NFTs
Your phone has many apps.

dApps are pretty much the same thing, except they connect to blockchains using Smart Contracts.

how do we access these apps?

Well, they are on the internet. We use browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Brave to use them.

Here are some common dApps, which we will explore in the next lesson:
